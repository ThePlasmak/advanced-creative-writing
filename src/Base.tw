So, you can't hold in your laughter much longer. You let out a peal of laughter, and your old friend stops in her tracks.

She draws deep, labored breaths, then she meets your gaze. Assessing her [[options->options_comment_2]].

You know what to expect, and you [[wait->friend_fight_19]] for her next move.

:: friend_fight_19 [pink] {"position":"2625,2100"}
Maybe this would finally scare her away.

<<if $shot_friend_3 is true>>\
It is as if time has slowed down to a quarter of a second. You slice the bolt of fire midair, and it tears into two.
<<else>>\
You tighten your grip on the $weapon, and parry her attack. To your surprise, she lets the weapon go. It flies off to the other side of the room, and clatters on the floor, so you hear a ghastly echo.
<</if>>\

You compose yourself, then you laugh again. This is the first time you have seen your friend [[in years->tween_flashback_1]], and her first reaction is to try to kill you?

:: tween_flashback_1 [flashback long-t8n pink] {"position":"275,2300"}
<<timed 2.5s t8n>>\
Maybe she is still too scared.

You are teenagers at the monastery, and you heard that the nuns are  <<linkreplace "burning books" t8n>>[[ritually destroying heretic texts->tween_flashback_2]]<</linkreplace>> today.
<</timed>>\

:: tween_flashback_1_1
Most of them were stolen, but some were confiscated from an acolyte in the monastery.

She has been locked away, to be [[reeducated and reintegrated->tween_flashback_2]]. /* TODO: may want to improve this */

:: tween_flashback_2 [flashback pink] {"position":"400,2300"}
But that does not stem your curiosity.

You are young, and <<include "cycling_tween_flashback_2">>. You want to steal one of these texts before they are destroyed.

And your friend is refusing to help you. They are banned for a reason, she says.

They're dangerous. It's best not to read them in the first place.

But you tell her, don't you want to know what's out there? There must be worlds other than the one we know.

She pauses. Okay, she says, but how?

It's not that difficult, you answer. Just sneak into the library storage room [[during the assistant's break->tween_flashback_3]].

So you waited with her in the library, waiting for the assistant to leave.

The assistant steps out, and the both of you [[sneak in->tween_flashback_4]].

:: tween_flashback_4 [flashback pink] {"position":"650,2300"}
Inside, you see piles of thick, yellowed books and loose paper. The books do not look very different from the books in the library. You feel a little disappointed.

Your friend is telling you to leave. Let's go now, please.

Just as you turn around, you notice that one of the books is [[glowing pink->tween_flashback_5]].

:: tween_flashback_5 [flashback pink] {"position":"775,2300"}
You don't remember picking it up, but you remember your friend telling you to put it down.

She says, it must be cursed, please leave it here.

That makes you want to [[read it more->tween_flashback_6]].

[[You learn about the other god->tween_flashback_8]].

You spend your nights reading the book, and your time burns away.

A few days later, you tell your friend, please read it, there is another way we can live. A way beyond these walls.

Your friend says, I don't <<include "cycling_tween_flashback_8">> to know. But you insist. You ask her, don't you trust me?

She trusted you, because <<linkreplace "you were her friend" t8n>>she didn't have the strength to [[fight back->tween_flashback_9]]<</linkreplace>>.

:: tween_flashback_9 [flashback pink] {"position":"1275,2300"}
She opens the book to a page in the middle.

Your friend seems transfixed, as she flips to the next page, then the next, ignoring you, and everything around her.

Then, she stops, and [[throws the book down->tween_flashback_10]].

:: tween_flashback_10 [flashback pink] {"position":"1400,2300"}
She tells you, you should be reported for keeping this. You ask her, are you really going to?

She doesn't look at you.

No, she answers. Of course she can't.

She was always a [[coward->tween_flashback_11]].

:: tween_flashback_11 [flashback pink] {"position":"1525,2300"}
After that, she doesn't strike as hard during training sessions, doesn't answer as many questions in class, and doesn't talk to you as often.

She lives [[like a ghost->tween_flashback_12]].

:: tween_flashback_12 [flashback pink] {"position":"1650,2300"}
You don't apologise to her, but you tell her that you won't force her to do anything again. You know that this sickness is your fault.

Maybe she read something which was too dangerous for her. Maybe the very idea of other paths and choices was too dangerous for her.

Ideas are the most dangerous things in the universe.

You wonder if reading the book broke her, somehow. You wonder if you are the reason why she has lost her [[faith->chapter_3]].

You cannot tell the difference between her memories and your memories, which are thoughts as well. Maybe nothing ever existed, it's only thoughts. Time slows down until all that exist are your thoughts, and her thoughts. Maybe time does not exist, it's only thoughts. Maybe space is also a fabric of thoughts. At the beginning of the universe there were her thoughts, and when the universe dies all that will remain will be her thoughts. Time has never existed for her, because her thoughts are beyond time and space. There has never been any time, or space, only her thoughts. Her thoughts are beyond reality, beyond time, beyond structure. Her thoughts break the childish thought of structure. Maybe you thought this was freedom. Maybe thoughts will give you the freedom you want. Thoughts give you choices. Choices give you freedom, so thoughts give you freedom. Her thoughts can give you freedom. Freedom from the limitations of your body, time, and your thoughts. So you let her thoughts in. Now what you thought was your identity, your self, your personhood no longer exists. The barriers between you and reality, and time, and space, and her, no longer exist. You can reshape reality, just like you can reshape your thoughts. Reality is only your thoughts, which are her thoughts. What you thought were your thoughts are now her thoughts. You can see nothing, hear nothing, feel nothing, but her thoughts. Her thoughts are in your mind and your brain and your veins and your bones and your entire body. Your body is a thought. It is one of her thoughts. You thought your body was yours but it was always one of her thoughts, just like how she thought the universe into existence. The universe was always a patchwork of her thoughts. The only thing that has existed are her thoughts. Her thoughts are all you think. You can only think her thoughts. Her thoughts are the only thing that exist, for they are the substance of this shallow universe. It's all just her thoughts. Her thoughts are there. Her thoughts are here. Her thoughts are yours. Her thoughts. Her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are your thoughts are her thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts are thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughtsththoughtsthoughtsthough tsthoughtsthoughtsthoughtsthoughtsthoughtsthoughtsthoughtsthoughtsthoughtsthoughts oughtst houghts houghts thoug ht sthoughtsth ought sthough tsth oug htsthough tsthoughtsthou ght sthoughtsth thou ghtsthough tsthou ghtsthoughtstho u ghtsthought st hough tsthou ghtsthou ghtsth oughtsth ou ght sth o ughtsthoughtsth ough tst houghtsthoughtstho ughtsth ou ghtsthough tsthoug htsth ough tsthoughts thoughtsthough tsthoughtsth o ug htsth o ugh t st ho ught s thou gh t st hou gh ts th oug h tst  hou gh tsth ou ght sth ou ght sth oug h tst ho ug h ts th o ug hts tho ug htst h o ug hts t ho ug hts t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s t h o u g h t s
