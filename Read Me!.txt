========*READY-to-USE TWEEGO*========

To use this, copy the folder somewhere else so the Story Map doesn't show other projects.

To open the Story Map, go to T3LT (in the left sidebar of VS Code), and click on the Story Map button.

========Thanks!

========Credits:
Tweego is a free (gratis and libre) command line compiler for Twine/Twee story formats, written in Go, created by TME (https://github.com/tmedwards/tweego). The Ready-to-Use folder is based on the one put together by Sjoerd (https://github.com/SjoerdHekking/).

The Folder and Guide are under a CC-0 license. Please consider crediting at least TME if you use it, as he created the compiler in the first place.

========This Folder includes:
- A Ready-to-Code Project
- The Minimal Base needed.
	A JavaScript file for script code (currently empty).
	A CSS file for stylesheets (currently empty).
	A file with extra Special Passages, basic HTML styling, and base macros.
	A Tweego Explanation File.
	A compiled example HTML file  (visible here) and its debug version.
- Relevant Tweego Files (v2.1.1-Twee 3) for a SugarCube project.
- An Easy-to-Use Compiler with a cheat sheet.

========Template made by manonamora with Sugarcube (v 2.36.1).
A New IFID should be generated before using the template. See the *How to Change IFID* file.

========Notes:
This is only a basic guide on installing and using Tweego for a SugarCube project. It can obviously be used with other formats.

If you have any questions about or any issue with the template, send me an ask over on Tumblr or comment on the asset page.
